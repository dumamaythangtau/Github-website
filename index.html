            <p class = "para">For general use, a gpu with 2gb is more than adequate, but gamers and
                creative pros should aim for at least 4gb of gpu vram. The amount of 
                memory you need in a graphics card ultimately depends on what resolution
                you want to run games at, as well as the games themselves.
                When rendering graphics, your GPU performs a huge number of calculations 
                per second. This happens whenever the image changes on your screen, even in 
                something as simple as moving your mouse. Because the GPU is responsible for 
                rendering these outputs, it needs video RAM (vRAM) to do so.
                When using an integrated graphics card, this memory is shared with 
                the CPU, so a percentage of the total available memory is used when performing 
                graphic tasks. However, a discrete graphics card has its own memory, which 
                the card uses to render details. Both AMD and NVIDIA manufacture great graphics 
                cards both for general use and gaming. The power of the GPU tends to be reflected 
                in the price, so it is not necessary to buy a graphics card geared toward gaming if 
                you are not interested in running games at the highest settings and want to get the 
                best performance per dollar possible.

        <p class = "para">
            The GTX 1060 was second on Steam's list of December hardware surveys of GPUs. This is for a good reason because 1060 
            became an excellent value proposition that offered superior performance in a 1080p high-to-ultra setting without breaking the bank.
            The GeForce GTX 1060 is a great graphics card for gamers who don't need the fastest graphics card, but still want good performance. 
            It's a solid choice for most games and it can also be used for video editing and other professional tasks.

            The GTX 1080 Ti is able to hit full stride in older games such as War Thunder, where it's 
            actually quite a bit faster than not just the 5700 XT, but also newer mid-range GeForce GPUs such 
            as the RTX 3060. At 1440p, the 1080 Ti is a full 35% faster than the 5700 XT and 22% faster than 
            the RTX 3060.The 1080 Ti is much better suited to 1440p gaming with the ability to push 1440p titles 
            at high-to-max at 60 or more FPS with ease. 4K, too, depending on the game. The 1080 Ti is not a 
            peasant GPU, nor a value one. It's for the best of the best

            Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super also supports real-time ray tracing, which significantly improves 
            the lighting and shadows in the game, providing a more realistic and immersive gaming performance. 
            It is also supported by many high-end games where you can try this feature and have a natural experience
            In terms of value, the 2070 Super is a great option for people looking to build a high-end gaming PC. 
            It places at the top of the charts for the FPS per unit of money spent on a complete PC. If you're only 
            looking at the graphics card, however, the RTX cards—and really any high-end GPU—look far less enticing.

            The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti and RX 6600 XT perform the same as the RTX 3070 is 20% faster than both. 
            As you can see, the Radeon RX 6600 XT is an excellent 1080p graphics card, an ideal partner for the 
            Ryzen 5 5600. You can build a very capable gaming rig for $350 plus a motherboard and memory kit.
            The 6600 xt is a great 1080p cards, beats 3060 ti a lot of times at that resolution. But its performance 
            falls off at 1440p due to small memory bus and less memory bandwidth.

        <p class = "para">
            The RX 580 graphics card is an excellent option for gamers seeking to upgrade their system today. It boasts 
            up to 8GB of VRAM memory capacity. This extra memory helps provide smoother, more realistic visuals at higher 
            resolutions than other cards in this price range. The RX 580 is still a pretty solid card for 1080p gaming 
            and is enough for 60fps. If you want a higher performance you need to upgrade. I have a system from sometime 
            which has an i5 6600k and a gtx 1060. The RX 580 and gtx 1060 are pretty much the same performance with some 
            games favouring the gtx 1060.
