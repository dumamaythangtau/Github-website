            <p class = "para">For general use, a gpu with 2gb is more than adequate, but gamers and
                creative pros should aim for at least 4gb of gpu vram. The amount of 
                memory you need in a graphics card ultimately depends on what resolution
                you want to run games at, as well as the games themselves.
                When rendering graphics, your GPU performs a huge number of calculations 
                per second. This happens whenever the image changes on your screen, even in 
                something as simple as moving your mouse. Because the GPU is responsible for 
                rendering these outputs, it needs video RAM (vRAM) to do so.
                When using an integrated graphics card, this memory is shared with 
                the CPU, so a percentage of the total available memory is used when performing 
                graphic tasks. However, a discrete graphics card has its own memory, which 
                the card uses to render details. Both AMD and NVIDIA manufacture great graphics 
                cards both for general use and gaming. The power of the GPU tends to be reflected 
                in the price, so it is not necessary to buy a graphics card geared toward gaming if 
                you are not interested in running games at the highest settings and want to get the 
                best performance per dollar possible.
